# _Lvl1QuickSetup_WOTLK
Skips the intro cinematic and set up keybinds, macros and interface options on level 1 characters
For 3.3.5

## How to use
Log on a level 1 character, setup your UI and then type /run saveAll() on the chat box, the next time you create a level 1 character of that same class the addon will attempt to restore your character specific macros, keybinds and action bars.

Make sure to edit the file ConsoleVariables.lua with a text editor since it contain settings specific to your interface setup.
